# Log4J-SLF4J-jul-Test

Some projects use SLF4J to forward logs to developers.
I prefer Log4J implementation to handle logs. (thanks to file rotation feature)
Netbeans IDE use jul for default logging.

This project is a template to collect logs from SLF4J and JUL, forward them to Log4J
POM file shows the required dependencies.
