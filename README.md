# Log4J-SLF4J-jul-Test

Some projects use SLF4J to forward logs to developers.<br/>
I prefer Log4J implementation to handle logs. (thanks to file rotation feature)<br/>
Netbeans IDE use jul for default logging.<br/>

This project is a template to collect logs from SLF4J and JUL, forward them to Log4J<br/>

POM file shows the required dependencies.
